They delved into pharaohs' tombs, including King Khufu's and King Khafre's, discovering hidden chambers and ancient graffiti.  Their exploration extended to a submerged tomb beneath the pyramids, encountering a 3,000-year-old human skull.  They climbed the pyramids, reaching previously inaccessible points, and even explored a workman's tomb containing skeletal remains.  The journey challenged existing theories about pyramid construction, ultimately supporting the established view of ancient Egyptian builders.  The adventure concluded with a message for the future left within the Sphinx.
